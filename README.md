# Portfolio-Nikhil-Nishad

Welcome to my personal portfolio website! This website was created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and serves as a showcase of my skills and projects.

The site includes information about my background and experience, as well as a selection of my past work. You can find examples of my web development projects, along with screenshots and descriptions of their features and technologies used.

The site is fully responsive, meaning it will adjust to the size of the screen it is viewed on, so you can access it from any device.

If you have any questions or would like to discuss potential projects, please don't hesitate to reach out through the contact form or email provided.

Thank you for visiting my portfolio!
